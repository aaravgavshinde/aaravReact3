                <p>Everything you see on a website, like buttons, links, animations, and more, were created by a front
                    end web developer. It is the front end developer's job to take the vision and design concept from
                    the client and implement it through code.

                <p>
                    Everything on the page from the logo to the search bar, buttons, overall layout and how the user
                    interacts with the page was created by a front end developer. Front end developers are in charge
                    of the look and feel of the website. Front end developers also have to make sure the website looks
                    good on all devices (phones, tablets, and computer screens).

                    <h5>The three main languages you need to know well are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. From there you can focus on
                        frameworks, libraries, and other useful tools.</h5>
                    <h5 className="text-success-emphasis">HTML</h5>
                    <p>
                        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. HTML displays the content on the page like buttons, links, headings,
                        paragraphs, and lists.
                        You should not use HTML for styling. That is what CSS is for.
                    </p>
                    <h5 className="text-success-emphasis">CSS</h5>
                    <p>
                        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is responsible for the style of your web page including colors,
                        layouts, and animations.
                        Responsive design is essential in creating websites that look good on all devices.
                        Accessibility is the practice of making sure that everyone can easily use your web sites. You do not want to
                        create web sites that cannot be used by those with assistive technologies like screen readers.
                        After completing the course, you will be able to starting building small web pages.

                    <h5 className="text-success-emphasis">JavaScript</h5>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript allows users to interact with the web page. JavaScript can be used in online games, web pages,
                        mobile applications and more.

                    <h2 id="3" className="text-dark bg-dark-subtle">Back-end</h2>
                    <p>
                        Back-end development means working on server-side software, which focuses on everything you canâ€™t see on a
                        website. Back-end developers ensure the website performs correctly, focusing on databases, back-end logic,
                        application programming interface (APIs), architecture, and servers. They use code that helps browsers
                        communicate with databases, store, understand, and delete data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On a team, back-end developers collaborate with front-end developers, product managers, principal
                        architects, and website testers to build the structure of a website or mobile app. Back-end developers must
                        be familiar with many kinds of tools and frameworks, including languages such as Python, Java, and Ruby.
                        They make sure the back-end performs quickly and responsively to front-end user requests.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Back-end developer tasks and responsibilities</h4>
                    <p>
                        Back-end developers are required to have technical expertise, analytical thinking, and excellent
                        collaboration skills. As a back-end web developer, you should be able to work independently to design the
                        web infrastructure.

                        Heres what many back-end developers do on a day-to-day basis:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Build and maintain websites: A back-end developers main responsibility is to use various tools, frameworks,
                                and languages to determine how best to develop intuitive, user-friendly prototypes and turn them into
                                websites. This requires an understanding of cross-platform functionality and compatibility.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Write high-quality code: To produce sustainable web applications, developers must write clean and easily
                                maintainable code.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Perform quality assurance (QA) testing: Create and oversee testing schedules to optimize user interface
                                and
                                experience, ensuring optimal display on various browsers and devices.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Assess efficiency and speed: Once a website is up and running, and during updates and edits, developers
                                need
                                to assess its performance and scalability, adjusting code as necessary.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Troubleshoot and debug: Be able to troubleshoot issues and resolve them, while communicating them to
                                project
                                managers, stakeholders, and QA teams.

                                training and mentorship for junior developers.
                            </li>
